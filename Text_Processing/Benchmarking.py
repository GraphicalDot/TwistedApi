        Visited the place for a friend's birthday bash. Lots of people have written detailed reviews about this place. So am giving a quick short review:1. Ambience is great. They have divided the place into fine dining, disc, and outdoor lounge area. However the outdoor area is still covered by a makeshift tent like a large pavilion with numerous ACs running to keep the place cool.2. Food is average. Can't say I tasted anything that I haven't had before. However, expect good food and you won't be disappointed. Do try their Paneer Chilli Pepper starter. Pizzas and risotto too was good.3. Drinks - here is an interesting (read weird) fact..even through they have numerous drinks in the menu, on a Friday night (when I visited the place) they were serving only specific brands of liquor. And way above even twice the MRP per bottle. So do make sure you carry a fat wallet if you are gonna drink.4. Service was good. A little slow but still everything came hot (except for the drinks of course!! ;)...but I guess the slow speed was due to the crowd present on a Friday night.And finally, if you are now planning to go (which I wouldn't say no to) do ensure you make a reservation. They DO NOT entertain without a reservation.Hope this was useful. Bon Appetit! :))

                Birthday the best day of my life. With the best people and the best time.About the place absolute bliss. Perfect combination of white and the fairy table. Beautiful outdoor tables. Amazing music after 11 as ofcourse being a Wednesday night.Talking about the food less options for the vegetarians and serves in a smaller quantity. Served hot a plus point that adds a little. We had the hummus with was good enough but not at its best. The panner chilly was was a must try for the vegetarians from the menu. And the Penne Alfredo pasta served hot and good with lots of garlic flavours which we absolute love. Less options of indian liquor but has a quite variety.In all spending the bday night at this place was an absolute worth.Also using the MFL card adds the bliss a 15% off on the overall bill.#Foodholic #Foodblogger #EatSleepRepeat

                I went to this place on a Sunday night. Firstly, the staff didn't let me occupy empty sofa seats which were empty throughout my stay at the place. I told the staff repeatedly for a shift to the sofa seats but they kept telling us that they were reserved. Secondly, the food that we ordered was pathetic. The pizza crust tasted like fried roti. The lasagne was way too salty. I actually wanted to rate this place 1 but their decor, ambience and music earned them 1.5.

                Very loud music...can barely hear your partner. Indoor restaurant roof looks out of place and probably under maintenance. Food and drinks are good though. Service is Ok and not good by international standards though price is on higher side...with too many service charges and taxes
